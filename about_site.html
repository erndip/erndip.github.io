	<h1>About this Site</h1>
	<p>This is a website. Obviously. If you’ve somehow found yourself on this website in a context other than my CA 155 class, I am thoroughly impressed. If you are a member of CA 155, you already know the information that I’m about to say in the next paragraph, so why bother reading it?</p>
	<p>As stated above, this is a website about myself that I made for my Com Arts 155 class. It’s really just an exercise in writing HTML and CSS code and applying basic principles of visual design, but I’m trying to fluff it up with some semblance of comedy because otherwise it would probably be REALLY BORING for you to read. The assignment technically calls for the website to present my “professional identity to the world.” And this website does not appear to do that, as I’m clearly not taking the writing for it very seriously. But, on the other hand, maybe this is really an attempt to show “an audience who might be interested in hiring” me that I have a personality and that I’m quirky and not like the other job applicants. Or, on the other other hand, maybe that was just an attempt to justify my satirical tone so that my TA doesn’t yell at me. Who knows?</p>
