				<p>This is the website that I made as a project for my Communication Arts 155 class. I think it’s supposed to be “professional” looking where you could show it to potential employers, but as we stand right now I don’t think that’s necessarily a fitting descriptor. Oh well. Here are all the webpages I made as part of the site.</p>
				<!--<p>Why in the world are you reading the intro paragraph for my Site Portfolio page on the picture of the Site Portfolio page instead of just looking at the regular Site Portfolio intro paragraph?? Why would you expect to find something different?? Well regardless, you found something different, so good job. Real good job. Everyone is SOOOOO proud of you for wasting your time to read ALL of the text on my website.</p>-->
