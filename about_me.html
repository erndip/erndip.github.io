	<p>Congratulations! You found the part of the project where I talk all about myself! I’m a freshman, I haven't declared a major yet, I’m from Wisconsin, blah blah blah. My favorite class that I’m in this semester is this one called Communication Arts 155 and it’s my favorite because instead of finding derivatives or balancing ionic equations I get to make cute artsy projects like this website.</p>
	<p>“What do you hope to get out of this class?” I hear you ask. Just kidding, I know you didn’t ask that. But this page is called “About Me”, so I can write whatever I want. To be honest, I took this class because I wanted a really easy class that would give me a really easy A. Kidding, again, I actually took it because I’ve always taken loads of STEM classes my entire life because that’s what I’m good at and I told my parents that I’m “probably gonna major in comp sci or something like that,” but in reality I have no intention of going into any STEM-related fields because I realized that STEM jobs sucks big booty cheeks so instead I want to explore media production-related careers, but that’s only something I figured out about myself like within the last year, so I haven’t gotten around to telling my parents so I’m kind of just slowly, smoothly easing myself into being a Com Arts major.</p>
	<p>As for my biggest fears: my biggest fear in life is that I will not pass Communication Arts 155. So if the person reading this happens to be my TA, please give me a good grade Samantha. I’m begging you. I need this. Please.</p>
